        I'm a software developer who found my way into coding through my love for
        music, gaming and creativity. As a musician, I've always been drawn to creating
        something from nothing, whether it's composing a melody or building a
        web application. That same passion for rhythm and harmony naturally
        translates into how I approach code.
        <br />
        <br />
        My development journey started with curiosity about how websites work,
        and before I knew it, I was deep into JavaScript ecosystems, working
        with the MERN Stack, I've had the chance to contribute to some cool
        projects from helping build Shopify e-commerce platforms using Liquid
        templating to creating my own cinema management system and even a drum
        sequencer (the musician in me couldn't resist!).
        <br />
        <br />
        What really excites me is that sweet spot where technology meets
        creativity. Whether I'm optimizing an e-commerce workflow or crafting a
        beat-making app, I bring the same attention to detail and user
        experience that I'd put into a musical performance. Every project is
        like composing a new song, it needs to flow well, sound great, and
        connect with people.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now, I'm diving deeper into full-stack development and exploring
        technologies that push boundaries. I love collaborating with others who
        share that same drive to create something meaningful. After all, the
        best music and the best code comes from working together.
